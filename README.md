DESIGN PATTERNS WITH JAVA
# Java Design Patterns

This repository contains Java implementations of commonly used design patterns. The goal is to demonstrate how these patterns can be applied in real-world scenarios and help developers write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code.

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This implementation is useful when a single shared resource or configuration is required throughout an application.

- **Example**: Database connection pool, Logging services, or Configuration settings.

### 2. Adapter Pattern
The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting one interface to another. It helps in making two different interfaces compatible by creating a "wrapper" class.

- **Example**: A legacy system interfacing with a new API, or different types of payment gateways integrated into a unified payment system.

### 3. Strategy Pattern
The Strategy pattern allows selecting an algorithm at runtime. It enables a class to change its behavior by changing its strategy without modifying the class itself.

- **Example**: Sorting algorithms (QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.) or different payment strategies (Credit Card, PayPal, etc.) in an e-commerce platform.
